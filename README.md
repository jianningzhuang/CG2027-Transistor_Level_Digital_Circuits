# CG2027 Transistor Level Digital Circuits

Building on the basic circuit concepts introduced through CG1111A and CG2111A, this module introduces the fundamental concept of carriers, operating principles of PN diodes and MOSFETs. Their IV characteristic in different operating region and their impact on the performance of logic gate will also be discussed. It explains the foundational concepts of inverters and analyses their performance in terms of power and delay trade-off. It also introduces logic synthesis and the fundamental timing analysis of logic gates. Besides the static CMOS logic, it will also cover pass logics or transmission gates logics.
